        <p>The Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that
            uses
            the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices.
            It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of
            local to global scope,
            linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a
            vast range of information resources
            and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW),
            electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.
        </p>
        <p>The Internet of things describes the network of physical objects
            that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and
            exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>Things have evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, real-time analytics, machine learning,
            ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors,
            and embedded systems.Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems,
            automation (including home and building automation), and others all contribute to enabling the Internet of
            things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of
            the
            "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security
            systems
            and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled
            via
            devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. The IoT can also be used in
            healthcare systems.
        </p>
        <p>There are a number of serious concerns about dangers in the growth of the IoT, especially in the areas of
            privacy
            and security, and consequently industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun
            including
            the development of international standards.

            <h2 id="Applications"><u><i>Applications:</i></u></h2>
        </li>
        <p>The extensive set of applications for IoT devices is often divided into consumer, commercial, industrial, and
            infrastructure spaces.

                <h3>smart home</h3>
            </li>
            <p>A smart home or automated home could be based on a platform or hubs that control smart devices and
                appliances. For instance, using Apple's HomeKit, manufacturers can have their home products and
                accessories
                controlled by an application in iOS devices such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch.This could be a
                dedicated app or iOS native applications such as Siri.This can be demonstrated in the case of Lenovo's
                Smart Home Essentials, which is a line of smart home devices that are controlled through Apple's Home
                app or
                Siri without the need for a Wi-Fi bridge.There are also dedicated smart home hubs that are offered as
                standalone platforms to connect different smart home products and these include the Amazon Echo, Google
                Home,
                Apple's HomePod, and Samsung's SmartThings Hub.In addition to the commercial systems, there are many
                non-proprietary, open source ecosystems; including Home Assistant, OpenHAB and Domoticz.

                <h3>Manufacturing</h3>
            </li>
            <p>The IoT can connect various manufacturing devices equipped with sensing, identification, processing,
                communication, actuation, and networking capabilities.Network control and management of
                manufacturing equipment, asset and situation management, or manufacturing process control allow IoT to
                be used for industrial applications and smart manufacturing.IoT intelligent systems enable rapid
                manufacturing and optimization of new products, and rapid response to product demands.
